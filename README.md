## WHAT ARE BINARY TREES?
---
A binary tree is a type of data structure. Its main purpose is to store data. What makes a binary tree a unique data structure is that each node can have a maximum of two children. Binary trees can be implemented using the help of arrays or of linked lists/ nodes. Most data structures are abstract concepts and hard to visualize. Below, we will break down some essentials of binary trees and hopefully clarify any questions.

### COMPONENTS
1 **ROOT - the top-most node in the tree, starting node**
2 **PATH - the nodes at the edge of the tree**
3 **PARENT - a node who has children and isn't the root**
4 **CHILD - a node who has a parent pointer**
5 **LEAVES - the nodes found at the bottom most level, no children**
6 **SUBTREE - descendents of a node**
7 **LEVEL - representation of a nodes generation, root node will be at level zero**
1 **TRAVERSING - moving through the nodes, trees**
